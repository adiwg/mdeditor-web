### Because writing metadata

## should be fun!

Well, maybe that's a bit much to ask...but shouldn't writing high quality
metadata be ***easy***? So you don't know the difference between *ISO 19139* and
*FGDC CSDGM*? No problem! The mdEditor requires no special expertise or
knowledge. If you can use a web browser, you can use the mdEditor.

<p class="quote"><span class="fa fa-quote-left fa-2x fa-pull-left fa-border"
aria-hidden="true"></span> The main goal of the editor is to
promote the creation and use of metadata by lowering the level of technical
expertise required to produce archival quality metadata.
