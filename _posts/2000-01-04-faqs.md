1. ##### What metadata formats are supported?
 The native format used by the mdEditor is [mdJSON](http://github.com/adiwg/mdJson-schemas). However, the mdEditor can export to other metadata formats using the [mdTranslator](http://github.com/adiwg/mdTranslator).

1. ##### Is my metadata saved on the website?
 No, actually mdEditor runs inside your browser (it initially loads from our website).  Your metadata is **not** kept on our website, and the mdEditor will not transmit your metadata without you telling it to (e.g. translating or publishing).

1. ##### Where is my metadata saved?
 By default, the edited metadata is saved within the browser itself, in the **localStorage** cache, which allows the data to persist between page loads. This will retain the metadata until the cache is cleared.  You can also easily export the metadata to your local disk in mdJSON format at any time, or load an mdJSON file from disk.
